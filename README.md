# Context
This project was created for the sake of sharing the codebase for my master thesis „A Generic Approach for Clustering and Classification of Text Documents“ in 2019. 

# Abstract of Thesis
Many scientific disciplines overlap in the field of Natural Language Pro- cessing. This paper examines statistical approaches to Natural Language Processing. It analyses the statistical models Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Artificial Neural Networks. A theoretical introduction will be given to the reader and two different examples will be used to illustrate the models and their use. <br>
This thesis aims at developing and evaluating a generic methodology for clustering and effectively classifying documents. In the first step I use text- books as documents to adapt two models. These documents are already categorized by the initiators of the free online library Project Gutenberg. Thus it is possible to evaluate the clustering algorithm on a man-made grouping principle. As second step, the models developed in this manner will be tested on regulatory documents and guidelines of EUROSTAT (an authority of the EU) and compared with an already existing grouping. <br>
The open source software used is R. All codes used can be found in the appendix of this paper and are entirely reproducible.
